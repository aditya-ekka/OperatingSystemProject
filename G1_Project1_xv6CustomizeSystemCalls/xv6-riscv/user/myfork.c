//test file to check functionality of the custom myfork system call, which limits the number of child processes that can be created by a parent process to 5. The program attempts to create 6 child processes, and the expected output is that the first 5 child processes are created successfully, while the 6th attempt should fail with a message indicating that the maximum number of child processes has been reached.
